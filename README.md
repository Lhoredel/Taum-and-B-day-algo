# Taum-and-B-day-algo
This code solves the Taum and B'day problem by finding the lowest cost to buy black and white gifts. It takes into account the possible costs of converting between colors. The code looks at three scenarios: buying directly, converting white to black, and converting black to white. It then returns the cheapest option of the three.
